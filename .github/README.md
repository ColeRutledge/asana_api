<p>I had a great time making this app over the course of a few weeks. To build on my experience from the App Academy bootcamp, I really tried to expand on my "infrastructure as code" skills by utilizing multistage Docker builds, layered caching, and Github Actions to build a simple CI/CD pipeline. It was immensely satisfying glueing the pieces of it together with the Python skills I've been developing over the prior few months and to see it become a more robust, maintainable project complete with ðŸ’¯ percent test coverage! (not a great metric, I know, but it was still fun to chase!)</p>

### Takeaways:

<ul>
    <li>Infrastructure as code is <b>EXCITING</b>... serverless, lambdas, containers, <b>YES!</b> ðŸŽ‰</li>
    <li>GitHub Actions are going in <b>every</b>.<b>single</b>.<b>project.</b> âœ”</li>
    <li>pytest is powerful! ðŸ’ª fixtures, parametrized testing, and monkeypatching were all absurdly helpful.</li>
    <li>I'm firmly in the "pro-type hints" camp now.</li>
    <li>For simple projects, I doubt I'll look for a web framework outside of <a href='https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/' target='_blank'>FastAPI</a> for a long time. I learned more from <a href='https://github.com/tiangolo' target='_blank'>tiangolo's</a> documentation than I did from several weeks of bootcamp material. Thank you, SebastiÃ¡n!  ðŸ™Œ</li>
    <li>you can also thank him for the overzealous use of emojis in this repo as well! ðŸ˜€ </li>
</ul>

### Usage:

<p>I have prepared a docker-compose file, so after cloning, you should only need to setup a few environment variables. The Pydantic <b>Settings</b> schema in app.config provides valid defaults for all of these, so it should run regardless, but the required environment variables in a .env file are: </p>

```bash
APP_NAME="asana_fastapi"
DB_URL="sqlite:///app.db"
SECRET_KEY="dummykey"
ALGORITHM="HS256"                   # password hashing algorithm
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRES_MINUTES=30     # auth token expiration
```

<p>The project is setup with some SQLite defaults, but if planning to use PostgreSQL, the docker-compose requires the following in a .env.db file:</p>

```bash
POSTGRES_USER="db_username"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="db_password"
POSTGRES_DB="db_user"
```

<p>Alternatively, you can just pull and run the <b>dev</b> or <b>prod</b> <a href='https://github.com/users/ColeRutledge/packages/container/package/asana_fastapi'>image</a> from the GitHub Container Registry for this project by using one of these commands with the Docker CLI installed. After failing to find the image locally, Docker will look to the GitHub Container Registry for the image automatically. </p>

```bash
docker run --name asana_fastapi -p 8000:80 -d --rm ghcr.io/colerutledge/asana_fastapi:dev
docker run --name asana_fastapi -p 8000:80 -d --rm ghcr.io/colerutledge/asana_fastapi:prod
```
